Butterfly monitoring is crucial to gauging the health of butterfly habitats,
and monitoring data is very important when making butterfly conservation plans.
Volunteer monitoring efforts help scientists to compile data on changes in
butterfly frequency, species diversity, and location throughout the state.

Anyone can become a monitor, even if you don't know your local butterfly
species yet! You will learn the species as you go.
