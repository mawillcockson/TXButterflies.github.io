<dt>Can others join the project?</dt>

<dt>What is a route?</dt>
<dd>A route is any consistent path that a person can go along at a slow pace.  Routes should include at least one &lsquo;natural&rsquo; habitat.</dd>
<dt>How long should a route be?</dt>
<dd>A route should take between 30 min to 2 hours to travel at a steady pace. The distance depends, generally 1-3 miles.</dd>
<dt>How many different habitats can a route have?</dt>
<dd>Each route must have at least 1 habitat and no more than 5.  Habitats may occur more than once along a route.</dd>
<dt>How are habitats named?</dt>
<dd>Habitats are named by the route founder, the first person to establish the route.  Habitat names are not standardized, so monitors should choose descriptive names. In urban areas, &lsquo;roadside&rsquo; is a common name.  Other common habitat names are prairie, savannah, neighborhood, woodland edge. Habitats along water may be named for example riparian, wetland, marsh, shoreline, depending on the exact habitat.  For wooded areas, including the dominant tree species in the name may be helpful.</dd>
